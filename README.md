# ANN Benchmarking

This is a comparison of two popular Python (C++ under the hood!) libraries for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN) that take different approaches:
- [Annoy (Spotify)](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)
  - Builds search index using a tree-based algorithm
- [Faiss (Facebook)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
  - Uses hash table with Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a search index
